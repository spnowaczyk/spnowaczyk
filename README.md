Hi!
**My name is S.P. Nowaczyk, but you can call me Gerbill Green or Shariel.**
I am IT student, who's in love with C++.
My dream is to excel in low-level programming and become an old, bearded C-Wizzard one day.
This repository may seem (*or actually is*) empty because I am not satisfied enough with my collage projects enough to share them with the rest of the world.
Things I want to learn one day:

-  🌘 Lua
-  🧮 Assembler
 - 🍅 Kotlin
 - 🕹 Programming STM boards
 - 🔼 Arch

Right now, I am expanding my knowledge about:

 - 🐘 Postgres SQL
 - 🧙🏻‍♂️ C
 - 🐍 Python
 - 🐧 Linux
 - 🥷🏻 C++ (because C++ is like kung-fu - you can always get better at kung-fu)
